# Idea

1. Context->Provider->Provide common properties or methods for subcomponents

2. What is cached?->Real DOM

3. View rendering of components->Based on the real DOM of the append

4. How to do caching? -> object

- id: {nodes, ReactElement, status}

# Structure

1. Provider=>methods and properties

2. component => nodes => set methods of cache & component rendering
